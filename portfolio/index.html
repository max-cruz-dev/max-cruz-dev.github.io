                      <a href="https://www.squaredash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SquareDash</a>, SquareDash, a
                      veteran-owned startup based in Fort Worth, Texas, wanted to help roofers and restoration
                      contractors fix a nagging cash flow problem.

                      Whenever a contractor finishes a roofing or restoration job, they often have to wait for up to two
                      months before getting paid by an insurance company. Because all job expenses are front-loaded,
                      delays in payment often create cash flow difficulties for contractors that interfere in operating
                      their businesses.

                      SquareDash wanted to build a fintech solution that would enable contractors to get paid for
                      completed insurance jobs much faster — typically, within a few business days — via short-term cash
                      advances secured by insurance scopes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Built by Emerline from the ground up, SquareDash now operates a proprietary fintech platform that
                      supports key business processes within the roofing and restoration industry.

                      The solution enables contractors to quickly receive payments for completed jobs, while also
                      offering managed billing services. Using the capabilities of the SquareDash platform and billing
                      services, contractors’ interactions with property owners, mortgage companies, and insurance
                      carriers are automated and greatly simplified, allowing contractors to focus on scaling their core
                      business.

                      Our team was contacted by the client with the idea of creating a white label e-commerce portal.
                      The solution targeted at producers of digital products was supposed to allow them creating
                      individual e-shops in the convenience of a unified platform. Even though the requested solution
                      was a web one, the client also wanted to ensure easy mobile accessibility.
                      <br /><br />
                      <strong>Key Features</strong>

                      fully functional solution for e-commerce needs.The developed portal provides its users with an
                      easy registration process, allowing them to quickly set up an online shop and tailor its design to
                      their individual taste and needs. Because the portal can be conveniently accessed both via web and

                    <p>
                      In order to revolutionize professional services and make them more affordable, help people easily
                      find experts in the shortest terms, and simplify the process of getting needed services, our
                      customer came up with the idea to build an online marketplace with virtual offices for
                      professionals to provide their services to clients.

                      Our team put the idea into practice, while building both web and mobile products.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The solution is an online marketplace that provides a directory service and virtual office for
                      experts, thus reducing their expenses and increasing their visibility among potential clients.

                      On the other hand, the solution makes advice from professionals financially affordable and easy to
                      get.

                      The marketplace doesn’t imply any reference component — it’s an independent solution that doesn’t
                      influence the client’s decision.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Key Features</strong>
                      <br />
                      - <i>Smooth online interaction</i><br />
                      - <i>Experts only</i><br />
                      - <i>All cooperation steps included</i><br />
                      - <i>Meetings convenient for both parties</i><br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our solution is more than just a place where people find the professionals they want to consult.
                      The online marketplace is also responsible for booking the most convenient time slots, arranging
                      consultations, and conducting them using virtual conference rooms.

                      Three key benefits, a rich choice of experts, convenience of services, and accessible price, are
                      here in one marketplace. Thanks to our contribution, our client managed to democratize
                      professional services, while making them affordable for all social groups.
